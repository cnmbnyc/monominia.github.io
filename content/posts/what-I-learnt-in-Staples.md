You can only improve yourself through your only effort.

Don't work in an envioronment that you feel yourself not needed.

Pick up things quickly and fail fast.

Try your best to join a better place, always.

You only Live Once.

A big name do not mean it is a great name.

Don't blame others, blame yourself when you find you need to be stronger.

Always be positive, the opportunities are always more than you think.
