If you wanted to find a full time job, do not try finding a internship at first, just go directly to the full time job huntiing.

When you try finding an intership, they thought you didn't have the ability to get a full time job.

A small and low-bar company doesn't deserve your pay off. You can just kill time there and learn new knowledge by the same time.

Most of the SDE jobs in US shouldn't be taken by Chinese students, because their requirement is way lower than who we are.

NYC is not a tech city, so most of people here thought SDEs are just workload, and not intelligence.

Some people are super confident because they graduated from a famous college, or because they are born in US, but actually it means nothing.

The fancy and so-called high-end life in NYC is just a joke, the city is NB because of the history, not because of its innovations.

A company must have a super great idea to start from. If it didn't, then it must lose in the end.

Because even some companies with great ideas from the beginning failed eventually.

What we can do is decided by our managers, not decided by our ability or the company's potentials.
