      <description>We follow these principles Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer&amp;rsquo;s competitive advantage.
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
Build projects around motivated individuals.</description>

      <description>Background If we have a large set of structured data (identified by record IDs) stored in a set of data files, what is the most efficient way to know which file might contain our required data? We don‚Äôt want to read each file, as that would be slow, and we have to read a lot of data from the disk. One solution can be to build an index on each data file and store it in a separate index file.</description>

      <description>Indexes Indexes are well known when it comes to databases. Sooner or later there comes a time when database performance is no longer satisfactory. One of the very first things you should turn to when that happens is database indexing.
The goal of creating an index on a particular table in a database is to make it faster to search through the table and find the row or rows that we want.</description>

      <description>You can only improve yourself through your only effort.
Don&amp;rsquo;t work in an envioronment that you feel yourself not needed.
Pick up things quickly and fail fast.
Try your best to join a better place, always.
You only Live Once.
A big name do not mean it is a great name.
Don&amp;rsquo;t blame others, blame yourself when you find you need to be stronger.
Always be positive, the opportunities are always more than you think.</description>

      <description>If you wanted to find a full time job, do not try finding a internship at first, just go directly to the full time job huntiing.
When you try finding an intership, they thought you didn&amp;rsquo;t have the ability to get a full time job.
A small and low-bar company doesn&amp;rsquo;t deserve your pay off. You can just kill time there and learn new knowledge by the same time.
Most of the SDE jobs in US shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be taken by Chinese students, because their requirement is way lower than who we are.</description>
