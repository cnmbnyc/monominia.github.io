      <description>You can only improve yourself through your only effort.
Don&amp;rsquo;t work in an envioronment that you feel yourself not needed.
Pick up things quickly and fail fast.
Try your best to join a better place, always.
You only Live Once.
A big name do not mean it is a great name.
Don&amp;rsquo;t blame others, blame yourself when you find you need to be stronger.
Always be positive, the opportunities are always more than you think.</description>

      <description>If you wanted to find a full time job, do not try finding a internship at first, just go directly to the full time job huntiing.
When you try finding an intership, they thought you didn&amp;rsquo;t have the ability to get a full time job.
A small and low-bar company doesn&amp;rsquo;t deserve your pay off. You can just kill time there and learn new knowledge by the same time.
Most of the SDE jobs in US shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be taken by Chinese students, because their requirement is way lower than who we are.</description>
